One word: ease. For penguins If you're a penguin living in Antarctica, this is the perfect operating system for your personal computer, designed specifically for your use case. We should stop discriminating against non-human species and start treating them like real people; because that's what they are really like, and what they really deserve. Accessibility and flexibility PengiOS is incredibly accessible for penguins, with a super easy to learn KDE Plasma Desktop Environment, themed specifically to be easy on your penguin hands. Buttons and interfaces are large and easy on your penguin eyes so you can spend them hunting for fish instead of staring at small text on a screen. And being KDE, it's super modular, and you can customise it A LOT, as you wish. Education It comes with Luma Learn, currently under development, which helps your modular penguin brains adapt to desktop, GNU, Linux and general computer concepts through concise, educational, practical and often interactive tutorials. FREEEEEEDOOMMM It's also free software, sometimes referred to (in a different way) as Open Source, meaning we are innovating freely - with freedom (just like you penguins like) and without patents, rather than controlling users through restrictive or closed licenses, source code, and distribution. These are rights for not only humans, but penguins too, which you deserve. We aim to ship as little non-free software as possible, so you can inspect, tweak, distribute and re distribute the software as you wish. For humans PengiOS is for humans too. From penguin-lovers to new [GNU/]Linux users to normal people too, we've made the OS easy to use and to learn from. Great introduction to Linux with Luma! PengiOS is based on Luma Linux, made by us too, which has the goal of making Linux operating systems easy to learn for keen but unexperienced people, with many things set up for you, but still enough room for learning. Our software Luma Learn comes preinstalled on Luma and PengiOS, currently under development, that makes it good to learn new desktop, GNU, Linux and general computer concepts through concise, educational, practical and often interactive tutorials. Although neither are made for people who just want something that works without effort, if you put in a bit of effort to learn in this easy way, you can learn a lot and be better off in the end. Flexible Desktop... and PENGUINS!!!! Better? How? Well, our desktop environment, KDE Plasma, is easy to use and has been made with penguins in mind; for enthusiasts too! Who doesn't love a cute penguin? Who doesn't love a few constantly on your desktop, keeping you happy and productive through your day? Everything from our wallpaper to our UI to our themes to our naming to our startpage in Firefox is themed around these little fellows. Don't like them (:O)? KDE Plasma is super modular and customisable. FREEEEEEDOOMMM And finally, it's free software, sometimes referred to (in a different way) as Open Source, meaning we are innovating freely - with freedom (just like the penguins like) and without patents, rather than controlling users through restrictive or closed licenses, source code, and distribution. These are basic rights, that you deserve. We aim to ship as little non-free software as possible, so you can inspect, tweak, distribute and re distribute the software as you wish. I'm a pro! Well, that's great news for you! We also offer PengiOS Pro , based on Luma Flex (and hence, Arch) instead of Debian (Luma), using a preconfigured easy installer for more advanced yet still curious and adventurous users, penguins and humans alike. It uses a more advanced Hyprland window manager, but with a preconfigured environment for you unless you so choose. From there you'll have access to new theming options for your Hyprland environment, new Luma guides and tutorials specifically for our Arch-based distros (Luma Flex and PengiOS Pro), and new possibilities, while still being able to tinker freely and experiment outside of the tutorials, understanding everything about the system. The installer is friendly, good looking and easy to use, while still guiding through exactly what it's doing, using the 'traditional Arch method'. Overall, it's a great way for decently experienced but still curious users of PengiOS (or Luma) to extend their knowledge and transform their desktop into one that suits their needs.","title":"Why Pengi OS"},{"location":"why/#why-use-pengios","text":"One word: ease.","title":"Why use PengiOS?"},{"location":"why/#for-penguins","text":"If you're a penguin living in Antarctica, this is the perfect operating system for your personal computer, designed specifically for your use case.
